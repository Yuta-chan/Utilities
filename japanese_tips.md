# Japanese Tips
## Switch Between Mozc (Japanese Keyboard) and Default Keyboards
In Ubuntu Linux, you can easily switch between the [Mozc](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/mozc) Japanese keyboard and the default keyboards by following these steps:

1. Press the "Super" key (the key with the Windows or Linux logo) and the "Space" key simultaneously.

2. This will open a menu that allows you to switch between the Japanese keyboard and the default keyboards using the arrow keys.

Following these steps, you can quickly and easily toggle between keyboards as needed.

If you don't have Mozc installed, you can easily do so by following the steps outlined [here](https://sacchann.com/how-to-enable-japanese-input-in-ubuntu-22-04-1-lts-fcitx-mozc/). 

## Other Super Key Functions
The "Super" key, often labeled with the Windows or Linux logo, has additional functionalities in Ubuntu and other Linux-based systems:

- **Open Applications Menu:** Press the "Super" key to open the applications menu, where you can search for and launch programs.

- **Show Desktop:** Press "Super + D" to minimize all windows and show the desktop. This keyboard shortcut provides a quick way to access your desktop. If you press it another time, the desktop will return to its initial state.

- **Switch Between Open Applications:** Press "Super + Tab" to switch between open applications in a graphical interface.
